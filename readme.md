# Stonks

**Stonks** is a small chat-based game built as a challenge project during the SARS-COV-2 lockdown. 

It is designed to be a simplified (and consequentially inaccurate) simulator of the US stock market. 

This bot was built with discord-py and the iexfinance API. 

## Dependencies:

- discord-py 
- iexfinance
- numpy 
- pandas
- sqlalchemy

## How to run:


This bot is self hosted. To start the bot, make sure to run `initialise.py`.
